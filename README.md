# Bike-Paths-Game
This project finds safe bike paths in a national park modeled as interconnected hexagonal chambers. The program identifies a path from the park entrance to all treasure chambers while avoiding sealed or dark chambers. The algorithm prioritizes treasure and lighted chambers for safety and optimal exploration.
